# Gating and exit codes

Exit codes are the CI contract:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Gate passed |
| `1` | Gate failed |
| `2` | User or authoring error (bad path, malformed YAML, unknown assertion kind) |

A run fails the gate when the overall pass rate is below `min_pass_rate`, when a configured
per-skill minimum is not met, or when any case **errored**. Two distinctions matter:

- **failed** — the case ran and scored below the bar. An *eval* signal.
- **errored** — the runner itself blew up (API error, timeout, missing key). An *infra* signal,
  and it fails the gate by default so CI never goes green on a broken run.

A case that fails its assertions drags the pass rate below the bar and fails the gate:

```
[FAIL] badskill :: expects something absent (fake)
        assertion: failed: contains('NEVER_PRESENT')

0 passed, 1 failed, 0 errored — pass rate 0%

Gate FAILED:
  - pass rate 0% is below the required 100%
```

**A run that executed zero cases also fails.** "Nothing ran" is a broken run, not a pass —
otherwise a mistyped path reports success forever. The reason names the cause: no skills found,
all skills skipped for having no eval cases, or every case filtered out by `--tag`.

```
Skipped (no eval cases): badskill

0 passed, 0 failed, 0 errored — pass rate 0%

Gate FAILED:
  - no eval cases ran: all discovered skill(s) were skipped for having no eval cases: badskill
```

## JSON report

`--json-output report.json` writes a machine-readable report alongside the console output:
a `summary` block (counts, overall and per-skill pass rates, token/cost/latency totals),
`skipped_skills`, `tag_filtered_skills`, a per-case `outcomes` list, and the `gate` decision
with its reasons.
